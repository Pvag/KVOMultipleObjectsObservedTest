KVOMultipleObjectsObservedTest
==============================

This is a test developed after the very good tutorial of AppleProgramming (Lucas Derraugh) on youtube, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6Fu15G_XmU , Objective-C on the Mac L28 â€“ Key-Value Observing.

The relevant files are:
Dog.h
Dog.m
Person.h
Person.m
main.m

Ignore the other files, since i'm a git beginner and i can't clean up the mess i've made to put this repo online.
